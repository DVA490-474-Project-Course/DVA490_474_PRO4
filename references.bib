Various navigation solutions have been proposed, though few as widely adopted as ROS Navigation. 10 years on, it is still one of the most popular navigation solutions. Yet, ROS Navigation has failed to keep up with modern trends. We propose the new navigation solution, Navigation2, which builds on the successful legacy of ROS Navigation. Navigation2 uses a behavior tree for navigator task orchestration and employs new methods designed for dynamic environments applicable to a wider variety of modern sensors. It is built on top of ROS2, a secure message passing framework suitable for safety critical applications and program lifecycle management. We present experiments in a campus setting utilizing Navigation2 to operate safely alongside students over a marathon as an extension of the experiment proposed in Eppstein et al. The Navigation2 system is freely available at https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2 with a rich community and instructions.},

	abstract = {Advancing maturity in mobile and legged robotics technologies is changing the landscapes where robots are being deployed and found. This innovation calls for a transformation in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems to support this new generation of service and consumer robots. No longer can traditionally robust 2D lidar systems dominate while robots are being deployed in multi-story indoor, outdoor unstructured, and urban domains with increasingly inexpensive stereo and RGB-D cameras. Visual SLAM (VSLAM) systems have been a topic of study for decades and a small number of openly available implementations have stood out: ORB-SLAM3, OpenVSLAM and RTABMap. This paper presents a comparison of these 3 modern, feature rich, and uniquely robust VSLAM techniques that have yet to be benchmarked against each other, using several different datasets spanning multiple domains negotiated by service robots. ORB-SLAM3 and OpenVSLAM each were not compared against at least one of these datasets previously in literature and we provide insight through this lens. This analysis is motivated to find general purpose, feature complete, and multi-domain VSLAM options to support a broad class of robot applications for integration into the new and improved ROS 2 Nav2 System as suitable alternatives to traditional 2D lidar solutions.},

	abstract = {The accelerated deployment of service robots have spawned a number of algorithm variations to better handle real-world conditions. Many local trajectory planning techniques have been deployed on practical robot systems successfully. While most formulations of Dynamic Window Approach and Model Predictive Control can progress along paths and optimize for additional criteria, the use of pure path tracking algorithms is still commonplace. Decades later, Pure Pursuit and its variants continues to be one of the most commonly utilized classes of local trajectory planners. However, few Pure Pursuit variants have been proposed with schema for variable linear velocities - they either assume a constant velocity or fails to address the point at all. This paper presents a variant of Pure Pursuit designed with additional heuristics to regulate linear velocities, built atop the existing Adaptive variant. The Regulated Pure Pursuit algorithm makes incremental improvements on state of the art by adjusting linear velocities with particular focus on safety in constrained and partially observable spaces commonly negotiated by deployed robots. We present experiments with the Regulated Pure Pursuit algorithm on industrial-grade service robots. We also provide a high-quality reference implementation that is freely included ROS 2 Nav2 framework at https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2 for fast evaluation.},

Its success derives from its focused design and improved capabilities targeting product-grade and modern robotic systems. Following ROS 2's example, the mobile robotics ecosystem has been fully redesigned based on the transformed needs of modern robots and is experiencing active development not seen since its inception. This paper comes from the desks of the key ROS Navigation maintainers to review and analyze the state of the art of robotics navigation in ROS 2. This includes new systems without parallel in ROS 1 or other similar mobile robotics frameworks. We discuss current research products and historically robust methods that provide differing behaviors and support for most every robot type. This survey consists of overviews, comparisons, and expert insights organized by the fundamental problems in the field. Some of these implementations have yet to be described in literature and many have not been benchmarked relative to others. We end by providing a glimpse into the future of the ROS 2 mobile robotics ecosystem.},

This work is motivated by the lack of performant and available feasible planners for mobile and surface robotics research.
 This paper contains three main contributions. First, it briefly describes a minimal open-source software framework where search-based planners may be easily added. Further, this paper characterizes new variations on the feasible planners - dubbed Cost-Aware - specific to mobile roboticist's needs. This fills the gap of missing kinematically feasible implementations suitable for academic, extension, and deployed use. Finally, we provide baseline benchmarking against other standard planning frameworks.
 Smac Planner has further significance by becoming the standard open-source planning system within ROS 2's Nav2 framework which powers thousands of robots in research and industry.},

Even in a myriad of applications and environments, there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots share—the need for a modular, scalable, and reliable architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1 was not designed with many necessary production-grade features and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales. In this Review, we highlight the philosophical and architectural changes of ROS 2 powering this new chapter in the robotics revolution. We also show through case studies the influence ROS 2 and its adoption has had on accelerating real robot systems to reliable deployment in an assortment of challenging environments.

            This Review describes ROS 2’s design, features, and performance with four case studies on land, air, sea, and even space.},

	abstract = {Wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) have been a focus of research for several decades, particularly concerning navigation strategies in static and dynamic environments. This review article carefully examines the extensive academic efforts spanning several decades addressing navigational complexities in the context of WMR route analysis. Several approaches have been explored by various researchers, with a notable emphasis on the inclusion of stability and intelligent capabilities in WMR controllers attracting the attention of the academic community. This study traces historical and contemporary WMR research, including the establishment of kinetic stability and the construction of intelligent WMR controllers. WMRs have gained prominence in various applications, with precise navigation and efficient control forming the basic prerequisites for their effective performance. The review presents a comprehensive overview of stability analysis and navigation techniques tailored for WMRs. Initially, the exposition covers the basic principles of WMR dynamics and kinematics, explaining the different wheel types and their associated constraints. Subsequently, various stability analysis approaches, such as Lyapunov stability analysis and passivation-based control, are discussed in depth in the context of WMRs. Starting an exploration of navigation techniques, the review highlights important aspects including path planning and obstacle avoidance, localization and mapping, and trajectory tracking. These techniques are carefully examined in both indoor and outdoor settings, revealing their benefits and limitations. Finally, the review ends with a comprehensive discussion of the current challenges and possible routes in the field of WMR. The discourse includes the fusion of advanced sensors and state-of-the-art control algorithms, the cultivation of more robust and reliable navigation strategies, and the continued exploration of novel WMR applications. This article also looks at the progress of mobile robotics during the previous three decades. Motion planning and path analysis techniques that work with single and multiple mobile robots have been discussed extensively. One common theme in this research is the use of soft computing methods to give mobile robot controllers cognitive behaviors, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic control (FLC), and genetic algorithms (GAs). Nevertheless, there is still a dearth of applications for mobile robot navigation that leverage nature-inspired algorithms, such as firefly and ant colony algorithms. Remarkably, most studies have focused on kinematics analysis, with a small number also addressing dynamics analysis.},

	abstract = {The paper describes how to formally specify three path finding algorithms in Maude, a rewriting logic-based programming/specification language, and how to model check if they enjoy desired properties with the Maude LTL model checker. The three algorithms are Dijkstra Shortest Path Finding Algorithm (DA), A* Algorithm and LPA* Algorithm. One desired property is that the algorithms always find the shortest path. To this end, we use a path finding algorithm (BFS) based on breadth-first search. BFS finds all paths from a start node to a goal node and the set of all shortest paths is extracted. We check if the path found by each algorithm is included in the set of all shortest paths for the property. A* is an extension of DA in that for each node [Formula: see text] an estimation [Formula: see text] of the distance to the goal node from [Formula: see text] is used and LPA* is an incremental version of A*. It is known that if [Formula: see text] is admissible, A* always finds the shortest path. We have found a possible relaxed sufficient condition. The relaxed condition is that there exists the shortest path such that for each node [Formula: see text] except for the start node on the path [Formula: see text] plus the cost to [Formula: see text] from the start node is less than the cost of any non-shortest path to the goal from the start. We informally justify the relaxed condition. For LPA*, if the relaxed condition holds in each updated version of a graph concerned including the initial graph, the shortest path is constructed. Based on the three case studies for DA, A* and LPA*, we summarize the formal specification and model checking techniques used as a generic approach to formal specification and model checking of path finding algorithms.},

Within path planning, obstacle avoidance is a crucial task in robotics, as the autonomous operation of robots needs to reach their destination without collisions. Obstacle avoidance algorithms play a key role in robotics and autonomous vehicles. These algorithms enable robots to navigate their environment efficiently, minimizing the risk of collisions and safely avoiding obstacles. This article provides an overview of key obstacle avoidance algorithms, including classic techniques such as the Bug algorithm and Dijkstra’s algorithm, and newer developments like genetic algorithms and approaches based on neural networks. It analyzes in detail the advantages, limitations, and application areas of these algorithms and highlights current research directions in obstacle avoidance robotics. This article aims to provide comprehensive insight into the current state and prospects of obstacle avoidance algorithms in robotics applications. It also mentions the use of predictive methods and deep learning strategies.},

	abstract = {The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has become a standard technique used in a number of nonlinear estimation and machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system, estimating parameters for nonlinear system identiﬁcation (e.g., learning the weights of a neural network), and dual estimation (e.g., the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) where both states and parameters are estimated simultaneously. This paper points out the ﬂaws in using the EKF, and introduces an improvement, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman [5]. A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman Filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF, the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the ﬁrst-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the ﬁlter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF, in contrast, only achieves ﬁrst-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF.},

It is safe by construction, and has been shown to perform very efficiently in experimental setups. However, one can construct examples where the proposed scheme fails to attain the goal configuration. What has been lacking is a theoretical treatment of the algorithm's convergence properties. Here we present such a treatment by merging the ideas of the DWA with the convergent, but less performance-oriented, scheme suggested by Rimon and Koditschek. Viewing the DWA as a model predictive control (MPC) method and using the control Lyapunov function (CLF) framework of Rimon and Koditschek, we draw inspiration from an MPC/CLF framework put forth by Primbs to propose a version of the DWA that is tractable and convergent.},

However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the stochasticity in people's behaviors. Existing works are mostly focused on using feature-matching techniques to describe and imitate human paths, but often do not generalize well since the feature values can vary from person to person, and even run to run. This work notes that while it is challenging to directly specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms). Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms. The proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a robotic vehicle moving at human walking speed in an environment with many pedestrians.},

While such methods as Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance guarantee local collision-free motion for a large number of robots, given perfect knowledge of positions and speeds, a realistic implementation requires further extensions to deal with inaccurate localization and message passing delays. The presented algorithm bounds the error introduced by localization and combines the computation for collision-free motion with localization uncertainty.

	abstract = {Graduates are increasingly expected to work in international contexts, therefore skills in intercultural interaction are crucial. Previous research suggests that overseas students anticipate positive intercultural interaction but are often disappointed, as some home students are unwilling to work in intercultural groups without explicit encouragement. In this study, we investigated interactions in three group work settings with home (UK) and international students in order to explore differing patterns of participation. The findings suggest that in culturally mixed groups, the UK students (particularly males) dominated discussions, with limited input from overseas students. In a group consisting solely of international students, the interactions were much more equal. However, an analysis of influence on group decisions (in terms of proportion of suggestions accepted by the group), suggested that the influence of male home students was lower than their participation would imply. The research suggests that there is a need to plan and manage group work carefully, especially where there are diverse groups of students.},

	abstract = {Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a ubiquitous on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm but is signiﬁcantly less utilized than off-policy learning algorithms in multi-agent settings. This is often due to the belief that PPO is signiﬁcantly less sample efﬁcient than off-policy methods in multi-agent systems. In this work, we carefully study the performance of PPO in cooperative multi-agent settings. We show that PPO-based multi-agent algorithms achieve surprisingly strong performance in four popular multi-agent testbeds: the particle-world environments, the StarCraft multi-agent challenge, Google Research Football, and the Hanabi challenge, with minimal hyperparameter tuning and without any domain-speciﬁc algorithmic modiﬁcations or architectures. Importantly, compared to competitive off-policy methods, PPO often achieves competitive or superior results in both ﬁnal returns and sample efﬁciency. Finally, through ablation studies, we analyze implementation and hyperparameter factors that are critical to PPO’s empirical performance, and give concrete practical suggestions regarding these factors. Our results show that when using these practices, simple PPO-based methods can be a strong baseline in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

In this paper, we develop a multi-agent system to play the full 11 vs. 11 game mode, without demonstrations. This game mode contains aspects that present major challenges to modern reinforcement learning algorithms; multi-agent coordination, long-term planning, and non-transitivity. To address these challenges, we present TiZero; a self-evolving, multi-agent system that learns from scratch. TiZero introduces several innovations, including adaptive curriculum learning, a novel self-play strategy, and an objective that optimizes the policies of multiple agents jointly. Experimentally, it outperforms previous systems by a large margin on the Google Research Football environment, increasing win rates by over 30\%. To demonstrate the generality of TiZero’s innovations, they are assessed on several environments beyond football; Overcooked, Multi-agent ParticleEnvironment, Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-Four.},

	abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is promising for multi-agent path planning problems in which sparse external environmental rewards may cause the agent group to make overly conservative decisions and explore the environment inefficiently. In general, the reward shaping mechanism is used to mitigate the above problems with the additional reward function setting. However, it requires specific domain knowledge, which limits the general applicability, and the added reward functions are not necessarily applicable to all environments. This paper aims to improve the path planning efficiency of single agents and groups of agents with the Internal Curiosity Module (ICM) mechanism to boost the generalization abilities of the agents in different environments. To this end, we incorporate the internal curiosity mechanism into the soft actor-critic model for enhancing exploration strategies, adapting to environmental changes, and improving learning effectiveness. Then, we propose a multi-agent path planning method in which the curiosity mechanism is integrated with the Multi-Agent POsthumous Credit Assignment (MA-POCA) algorithm. The neural networks can automatically calculate the additional intrinsic rewards based on observed information about the environment and the actions taken by the group of agents. Based on our experiments, we make qualitative and quantitative analyses of the performance of the proposed methods and the baseline DRL methods. The experimental results show that our proposed methods can decline the number of learning episodes and the training time of path planning, so the proposed algorithms can accelerate the exploration of single agents or agent groups in the sparse reward environment.},

There are several classes in robotic football matches such as: Middle size, Small size, simulation and so on. One of the most essential parts of a soccer robot in Middle size and Small size classes in the kicking system, this system is in charge of kicking the ball upon the command issued by the processor of robot. Almost every team develops their own unique shooting device. There are three main approaches to design and implement the robot kicking system. In this paper we designed and developed multi power kicking system that enables loop and vary shooting power. To design a good solenoid and to obtain maximum velocity of ball some parameters like: inductance, response time, resistance, force, dimensions and core-material should be balanced carefully. We used a DC-DC converter (Boost regulator) for getting different currents to have different power of shooting. We are going to review the advantages of all of those approaches. Next we are purposes a novel Solenoid-based kicking system which has already been successfully implemented in Adro RoboCup team.},

This team description paper presents our approach in navigating some of the challenges in developing a new SSL team from scratch. SSL is dominated by teams with extensive experience and customised equipment that has been developed over many years. Here, we outline our approach in overcoming some of the complexities associated with replicating advanced open-sourced designs and managing the high costs of custom components. Opting for simplicity and cost-e↵ectiveness, our strategy primarily employs o↵-the-shelf electronics components and “hobby” brushless direct current (BLDC) motors, complemented by 3D printing and CNC milling. This approach helped us to streamline the development process and, with our open-sourced hardware design, hopefully will also lower the bar for other teams to enter RoboCup SSL in the future. The paper details the speciﬁc hardware choices, their approximate costs, the integration of electronics and mechanics, and the initial steps taken in software development, for our entry into SSL that aims to be simple yet competitive.},
